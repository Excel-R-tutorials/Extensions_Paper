## Abstract

Advanced health economic analysis techniques currently performed in Excel, such as incorporating heterogeneity, time-dependent transitions and value of information analysis, can be easily transferred to R. Whilst previous R tutorials for health economists have focused on setting up Markov models and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, there is a need for more detailed exploration and explanation of how to develop more advanced Markov models in R. This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide of how to incorporate heterogeneity and value of information with Markov models in R, through side-by-side comparisons of how such analyses are done in Excel. Though there are papers highlighting the efficiency benefits of R in comparison to Excel, and general tutorials of how to perform health economic analyses in R, we hope that this paper can act as a reference point to those switching more complex models from Excel to R. We provide open-access code and data, suitable for future adaptation.
